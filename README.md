# 🏋️‍♀️ AI Personal Trainer — Your YouTube-Inspired, On-Demand Fitness Coach

> *"I love YouTube workouts. But I always wished someone could just hand me a personalized plan every morning — based on my goals, mood, and time — and walk me through it like a real trainer would."*

## 🧠 What Is This?

**AI Personal Trainer** is an all-in-one, intelligent fitness assistant that **learns from real YouTube workout videos** and delivers **custom, guided workouts** — complete with virtual coaching, form feedback, and timing, like your own digital class.

It’s built for people who:

- 💃 Love the variety and vibe of YouTube workouts  
- 💪 Want something more tailored to their body goals  
- 🕒 Don’t have time to plan or second-guess their workouts every day  

This project was born from my own frustration:  
I loved doing fitness videos on YouTube, but I wanted a way to get a **workout plan crafted for me** — my focus areas, my time limits, and my goals.  
I wanted it to feel like I had a trainer ready *on demand* every morning.

So I built this.  
A personal AI trainer that does **exactly that**.
